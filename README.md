## Project Description

This is my **second attempt** at building a Todo App.  
This time I focused mainly on **logic and algorithms**, not CSS or styling.

Features include:
- Add new tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed / incomplete
- Save tasks in **Local Storage**

## Reflection

Compared to my first Todo App, this one was **much easier and faster** to implement.  
Maybe Iâ€™m actually making progress, haha ðŸ˜†.
